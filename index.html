				<p id="pr">programming languages
There are multiple languages ​​markup languages ​​inside the internet, and one of the most common examples is HTML.
 It is one of the necessary, important Internet protocols, which contains a large number of methods known in the field of publishing to form a link between the editor and the author.
Information about the html programming language and its uses
 It is an acronym for the term HyperText Markup Language, and it is called the hypertext markup language. It is a special markup language created for creating and designing web pages.
Programming language html is the backbone, and the main for web pages, and its infrastructure. It explains a detailed explanation of the form in which the mechanism of displaying the contents of the website is divided through the title and paragraphs, depending on the so-called tags.
What are the tags?
Tags are the main part of creating a web page, and through it the page takes several special commands and executes them, and uses them to create the shape of the web page, and all the tags are limited to the <,> tags, and they are two basic types:

Start tag: The user must set a start and end for each command or tag in order to be executed in a correct way, and the form should be like this < html >

- End tag: it is usually attached with the / sign to close the given command and it is placed in this way < html / >

History and development of the html language
- It was the first to invent the language of physicist Tim Berners-Lee Ak-Ak 1980, through the CERN Foundation for Nuclear Research, by preparing a form that helps researchers in the institution share documents.

Berners then created an Internet-based hypertext text in 1989


- In 1990 he wrote the provider program and HTML description

In late 1991, he presented a document to the public called html tags, in which he described the 18 elements that make up it.

During 1993 the first HTML specification proposal was published: “Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)”

Features and features of the html programming language
You don't need design programs, and just do notebook software that comes with Windows or WordPad.
Easy to learn as the user can design it for a page in a very short time.
It helps in making many changes to the website with ease.
The ability to write using the Arabic language.
It has the ability to add any scripts such as Java Scripts or DHTML scripts.
It allows the ability to translate scripts into Arabic.
The ability to precisely control the properties of the page.
Most of the design programs are based on the HTML language and are the basis for several programs such as Front Page.
Uses of the html programming language
Used in website design and programming

It consists of a set of medals used for:

Display images inside the page via the  tag
To display a large title within the page, we use the tag h1 
- Used to translate web pages and display them through the browser

- The html programming language is used to give instructions to the internet browser, and to guide the way text is displayed, links and images

- It helps to access the places where images, media, and text are displayed inside the webpage

- Provides the web browser with information about the page as its title, its keywords, and its description.

				<p id="pr"> Curriculum learning requirements:

Before you start studying CSS, you should be familiar with some basic concepts about the Internet and HTML, as well as the basics of building web pages. If you need to study these topics first, you can do so by looking at the HTML language curriculum on the site. You will definitely find the basic information you need there.

What is CSS?

CSS is an acronym for Cascading Style Sheet, which means flowchart style pages, and CSS technology is used in designing web pages so that the entire site can be controlled in terms of font type, color, or size without having to write those codes or repeat them in Each page within the site, and therefore it is possible through only one file to make any adjustments to all files, which saves a lot of effort and time. And the function of this technique is to control how the webpage is displayed without interfering with the content, which facilitates the process of managing the site. Modifying one CSS file will affect the design of all pages of the site. CSS files simplify the process of designing and managing websites, and solve many problems that any website developer might encounter. For example, if you designed your site using HTML, assuming that this site consists of five pages, then you want after a while. Development and modification of the way this website is presented ... You need here to redesign the five pages again, this is very easy and you have to start now. Assuming that your site contains more pages, so be 50 or 100 pages, then surely you will Feel free before proceeding with the development and modification ... As for if you have designed your site from the beginning using CSS technology, all you have to do is Just one file.
CSS style files eliminate the need to use many HTML commands, such as the FONT command that specifies the type of font, size, or color, as well as the TABLE command that is used to create tables, in other words anyone using CSS can design their entire site without using the tables as followed In traditional methods of page design, this does not mean that tables will not be used with CSS, as tables have another function which is to display and format data that need to be within a table. W3C has created this technology and made it a standard web design standard, and many sites have started to move from the traditional design method using tables to the new method using CSS technology.
What do we use CSS flowchart style pages?

First: Because it is currently an agreed upon standard, and the standards make things easier and easier, and also because CSS technology will be supported in the near future by all companies working in the field of information technology, which leads to their widespread use and therefore must Web page designers and developers learn it from now so that it is ready for the future.

Second: Because the CSS flowchart style pages will be compatible with future hardware and software, and therefore they will be used in many areas that may appear in the future and we cannot predict now.

Third: separating the content from the design, and this leads to simplification of the site management process, because the design can be controlled from one file, so some elements in the site design can be added and modified without the need to modify all the site files.

Fourth: Making the site files smaller, which leads to lower operating costs. It also helps your site visitor, regardless of the speed of his internet connection, to summon the site’s pages through his browser of any kind in a way faster than before.

			<p id="pr">What is JavaScript?
Javascript is a high-level programming language that is commonly used in website development. Netscape developed it as a way to add dynamic and interactive elements to sites.
Javascript is strongly affected by the Java language, is similar in composition to the C language and is based on ECMAScript, which is a programming language developed by Sun Microsystems. Over time it replaced a variety of other programming languages ​​to become a standard for browser programming.

JavaScript development
He invented the Java Brendan Ish language in 1995 under the name Mocha while working for Netscape, drawing inspiration from Java, Scheme and Self.

This language did not receive attention at first, but over time it became a source of interest for many programmers after adding new technologies and support for the Java language and called it JavaScript.

Javascript features
Javascript is used in programming by the client or what is called the client side, but it is characterized by many technologies and features, which we supply:

Implemented by the client side, for example, you can check the validity of any entries before sending the request to the server.
It is a relatively easy language to learn and close to English.
A separate programming language, not some people think, is related to Java.
Provides greater control services for browsers.
Interactive and fast.
It has rich interfaces and you can drag and drop components to enrich your interface with the required elements.
Functional programming language 3
JavaScript restrictions
Security Issues: Since most of the code is executed on the user's computer, it can sometimes be used for malicious purposes, which requires many people to disable it.
It does not support reading or writing files from the customer's side.
It cannot be used in networking applications as there is no appropriate support available.
It does not support multithreading, a technique in which multiple paths are executed simultaneously on the same processor.
Javascript display varies between different browsers and search engines, which causes the interface and functions to be inconsistent at times. 4
The difference between JavaScript and Java
The designation of JavaScript must definitely make us believe that JavaScript is linked to the Java language. Although both are C-based and used in client-side web applications, in the following lines we will explain some of the differences between them:
We cannot deny the fact that both JavaScript and Javascript is a programming language used to develop applications or different features of web pages, except that the code for each of them differs from the other.

The biggest difference is the type of application used. Java applications are run either from the desktop or through the webpage, which are standalone programs and usually open a separate program window. If you do not install Java, you will not be able to run its own applications on your device. While Javascript is usually included in all modern browsers so you will be able to use it easily when loading a web page. Through JavaScript, you can create different applications on the same web page, as you can also develop video games and work on them in the browser window.

Java software is usually based on calculation and logical thinking, and it works on programming from the server side in a large way, while Javascript is focused on the client side. This makes Javascript faster.

While Java can be used to develop massive programs, it often requires a large memory space that can cause the computer to run slowly or slow down to another program. On the other hand, JavaScript works with a small amount of memory, so it is very popular in many webpages due to the low memory requirements and the ability to provide many unique features.
